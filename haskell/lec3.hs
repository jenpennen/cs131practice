1. There's no explicit return since the right hand side of a function is what it returns

3. No differences between parameters and return types
4. We can only concatenate (++) on lists of the same type -}

      else "You're a nerd poser."

{- 
The let construct consists of two parts:
1. first part is btw the let and the in; here you define one or more "bindings"
to associate a name with an expression.
2. second part follows in; contains an expression where the bindings are used

Bindings are IMMUTABLE variables - cannot be changed!
-}

{- The where keyword -}
get_nerd_status gpa study_hrs =
  if nerd_score > 100
     then "You are super nerdy!"
     else "You're a nerd poser."
  where
      gpa_part = 1 / (4.01 - gpa)

{- 
1. first write the code
2. specify the bindings adter the where keyword

{- Rule of thumb
when defining bindings (variables) for a single expression (e.g. the example here), either one is fine
when defining bindings for use across multiple expressions, use where

So, we can make our example more concise by using name:

{- Guards are a compact version of the if-then expression

{- 
1. no equal sign after defining function
2. each guard begins with pipe | 
3. first part is a bool expression; to see if it evaluates to true
    second part is a "payload" expression"; returns if expression is true
4. guards evaluated from top to bottom and returns payload of the first guard that's true
